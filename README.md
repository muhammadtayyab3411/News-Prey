# Welcome to  News Prey

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About News Prey

News Prey is a web application that fetches the latest news around the globe. It was bootstrapped with [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It has the functionality to bring news of a specific category, or country and has an advanced search. [News API](https://newsapi.org) is used in the application to populate real-time news on the app.

## Getting started with News Prey

1. Go to (News API)[https://newsapi.org]
2. Signup to get your API key. It has a free plan for developers.
3. Make a file named **.env.local** on the root directory of the project.
4. Save your API key as `REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"`
5. Now you can run the React Application.

## Run Commands
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Warning
The free API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org) works only on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:3000) and you can only make 100 requests to the API per day. If you want to deploy the app you should go with the [paid plan](https://newsapi.org/pricing) of [News API](https://newsapi.org).
